# Front end Developer Portfolio

This repository contains an easy-to-customize developer personal portfolio template built with Sass, React, and JavaScript. It is lightweight and fully responsive. The site is static and ready to go if you just want to add your information and leave. The site has been built as modular as possible to make it easy to change styles and content.
